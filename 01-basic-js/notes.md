task :-
1. difference between let & var.
2. Dofference between var & const.
3. what do you mean by haisting. (when we dont declare value of variable but it execute the code)


Rules of variable :-

data types in javascript :-
 
 - data type is an attribute associative with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value .
 - in data type we used "typeof"operator  to know the what type of data it is .
 - mainly in javascript their are 2 types of data type.
 1. primitive 
    - In javascript there are 7 types of ptimitive data types.
    1. Number :- number are the type of data type those it contain some numerical value.
    2. String :- string is a type of data type that can hold some character like names...
    3. Boolean :- In boolean data type we get boolean value like true,false 
    4. Undefined :- In undefined data type the data is not define so that it will show undefined.
    5. Null :- In this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
    6. Bigint :- In bigint we will get big integer
    7. Symbol :- In symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type .

 2. Non-primitive or Reference
   - Non-primitive datatypes are the types of data type that can hold multiple ites in a single time.
   - non-primitive data types are - objects,array,functions.
   Objects :-
        - objects is a non-primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
        - Mainly objects are working on  ( key:value) pain.
        - The left hand side is our keys and right hand side are the value of the following object.
          
        ex:-
        Soumya = {
            college: "GIET",
            address: "BBSR",
            age: 43,
            salary: 50000,
            carrier: "Excellent"
        } 
 operator in JS :-
 -  operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
 -  ex. A + B 
 -  in above example A & B are the operands , '+' is the operators to do the addition.
